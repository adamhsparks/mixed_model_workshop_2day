# Summary: Analysis with Statistical Models in R

1. Identify probability distribution of data (more correct: of residuals/conditional distribution)
2. Make sure variables are of correct type via `str()` or `tibble::glimpse()`
3. Set appropriate contrasts (orthogonal contrasts if model includes interaction): `afex::set_sum_contrasts()`
4. Describe statistical model using `formula`
4. Fit model: pass `formula` and `data.frame` to corresponding modeling function (e.g., `lm()`, `glm()`)
4. Check model fit (e.g., inspect residuals)
5. Test terms (i.e., main effects and interactions): Pass fitted model to `car::Anova()`
7. Follow-up tests: 
   - Estimated marginal means: Pass fitted model to `emmeans::emmeans()` (formerly:`lsmeans::lsmeans()`)
   - Specify specific contrasts on estimated marginal means (e.g., `contrast()`, `pairs()`)

`afex` combines correct coding (3.), fitting (5.) and testing (7.):
- ANOVAs: `afex::aov_car()`, `afex::aov_ez()`, or `afex::aov_4()`
- (Generalized) linear mixed-effects models: `afex::mixed()`

# Statistical Model

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) (emphasis added):

> A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the **data-generating process**.

> The assumptions embodied by a statistical model describe a set of **probability distributions**, some of which are assumed to adequately approximate the distribution from which a particular data set is sampled. The probability distributions inherent in statistical models are what distinguishes statistical models from other, non-statistical, mathematical models.

> A statistical model is usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more random variables and possibly other non-random variables. As such, "a model is a formal representation of a theory" (Herman Ader quoting Kenneth Bollen).

> All statistical hypothesis tests and all statistical estimators are derived from statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of statistical inference.

# Some Example Data

Data from Revelle, Wilt and Rosenthal (2009). `?sat.act`:
> Items were collected as part of the SAPA project (http://sapa-project.org) to develop online measures of ability (Revelle, Wilt and Rosenthal, 2009). The score means are higher than national norms suggesting both self selection for people taking on line personality and ability tests and a self reporting bias in scores.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(psych)
data(sat.act)
sat.act$gender <- factor(sat.act$gender, 1:2, labels = c("male", "female"))
sat.act$education <- factor(sat.act$education)

# Linear Regression Model

- $\bf{y}$ = vector of ACT scores of length $n$ (*dependent variable*)
- $\bf{x_{\mbox{SATV}}}$ = vector of SATV scores of length $n$ (*independent variable* or *covariate*)

$$y_i = \beta_0x_{0,i}+\beta_{\mbox{SATV}}x_{\mbox{SATV},i}+\epsilon_i, \ \ i = 1, ..., n, \\
\bf{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon}),$$
where $\bf{x_0}$ is a vector of 1s of length $n$.

- Errors $\bf{\epsilon}$ are assumed to come from a normal distribution (i.e., uncorrelated).

- $\beta_0$ and  $\beta_{\mbox{SATV}}$ are scalars (i.e., of length 1) and called *regression coefficients* or *parameters* ( $\sigma^2_{\epsilon}$ is also a parameter). $\beta_0$ is also known as the *intercept*.

******

In matrix form this model can be expressed as:
$$\bf{y} = \bf{X}\bf{\beta}+\bf{\epsilon}$$

- Why is estimate of `SATQ_c` reduced by 35% (was `0.02453`)?
--

- In multiple regression, parameter estimates reflect effect after "controlling" for influence of all other predictors!
- What remains from a specific effect, if others variables are taken into account?

### Exercise 1 (Multiple Regression)

- Open `exercises/exercise_1_MR.Rmd` (or the exercise handout or  `exercises/exercise_1_MR.nb.html` for a nicer format of the instruction).
- Follow text and try to solve two small tasks helping you to get comfortable with multiple regression.
- The data comes with `R`, `data(USArrests)`, and contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.
- Research question: *Which variables predict murder rates and to what degree?* 
- Exercise 1: Create one simple linear regression model with murder rate as dependent variable and each of the other variables as independent variable.
    - Which of the three variables shows a significant effect on murder rates?
- Exercise 2: Create one overall model with murder rate as dependent variable and the three other variables as independent variables (without interactions).
    - Which of the three variables now shows a significant effect on murder rates? If there are differences, how can these differences be explained?

## Interim Summary: Linear and Multiple Regression

- Linear regression summarizes linear relationship with regression parameters, allows prediction
    - Intercept ($b_0$ or $/beta_0$): expected value of DV at origin of IVs (i.e., when IVs are 0)
    - Slopes (e.g., $b_1$ or $/beta_1$): gradient of line, amount by which y (DV) increases if x (IV) increases by 1
- Linear transformation of variables does not change significance of slope or adequacy of model
    - transformation can simplify interpretation of estimates and comparison across scales
    - in 1 predictor case: if both variables z-transformed, slope = Pearson correlation
- Regression allows including several predictors
- Potential problems **multicollinearity** (i.e., predictors correlated among each other)
    - imprecise regression estimates
    - increases standard errors
    - Potentially suppression effects or other regression problems can occur.
- Parameter estimates reflects unique contribution of each predictor (i.e., beyond what is explained by other variables or controlling for other variables)

- Interaction: Effect of one variable depends on value of another variable!
- For interactions of continuous covariates, it is common to inspect effect conditional at mean and plus/minus 1 SD from mean (Cohen et al., 2002).

```{r}
library("emmeans")
get_z_positions <- function(x, at = c(-1, 0, 1), round = 2) {
  return(round(mean(x) + at*sd(x), round))
}
pres_t <- emtrends(mp_3, specs = "education", var = "prestige", 
                   at = list(education = get_z_positions(Prestige$education))) %>% summary
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
pres_t
pres_t$prestige.trend * sd(Prestige$prestige)
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r}
summary(mp_3)$coefficients %>% zapsmall
```

]

---

- 2-way interaction always allows 2 interpretations: One variable is focal, other is conditioning variable.

```{r}
edu_t <- emtrends(mp_3, specs = "prestige", var = "education", 
                  at = list(prestige = get_z_positions(Prestige$prestige)))  %>% summary

edu_t
```


.pull-left[
```{r}
edu_t$education.trend * 
  sd(Prestige$education)
```

- Alternatively, we can inspect interaction by transforming one variable into numerical variable!

```{r}
Prestige <- Prestige %>% 
  mutate(edu_cat = cut(education, 3, labels = c("low", "medium", "high")),
         prestige_cat = cut(prestige, 3, labels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
         )
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## Alternatively, create unequal size groups based on theoretical quantiles.
Prestige <- Prestige %>% 
  mutate(edu_cat = cut(education, 
                       breaks = c(
                         0, 
                         get_z_positions(education, 
                                         at = c(qnorm(.333), qnorm(.666))), 
                         Inf), 
                       labels = c("low", "medium", "high")),

                       breaks = c(
                         0, 
                         get_z_positions(prestige, 
                                         at = c(qnorm(.333), qnorm(.666))),

# Formula Interface for Statistical Models: `~`

Allows symbolic specification of statistical model, e.g. linear models: `lm(ACT ~ SATQ, sat.act)`

Everything to the left of `~` is the dependent variable:
```r
y ~ x # univariate model
cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ x # multivariate model
~ x # one sided formula
```

Independent variables are to the right of the `~`:

| Formula | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Interpretation  |
| ------------------------|---|----------------------------------|
| `~ x` or `~1+x`         || Intercept and main effect of `x` | 
| ` ~ x-1` or `~0 + x`    || Only main effect of `x` and no intercept (questionable) |
| `~ x+y`                 || Main effects of `x` and `y`|
| `~ x:y`                 || Interaction between `x` and `y` (and no main effect) |
| `~ x*y` or `~ x+y+x:y`  || Main effects and interaction between `x` and `y` |

### Interim Summary

- A linear model attempts to describe data generating process of DV using IVs and distributional assumptions (e.g., normal residuals)
    - R formula interface allows specification in symbolic form
    - Regression equation allows predictions for arbitrary values of IVs
- Linear transformation of variables affects interpretation of estimates, but not overall adequacy of model
    - Multiple regression estimates coefficients while "controlling" for other IVs
    - Multicollinearity might affect estimates and precision
- Interactions test if effect of one variable depend on value of other variable (i.e., magnitude of effect of one variable changes conditional on value of other variable)
    - Interpretation of interaction often not obvious (e.g., 2-way interaction has two possibilities)
    - If model involves interaction, estimates of lower order effects are effect if other variables are 0 (centring of variables often provides reasonable interpretation if interactions are involved)

# Categorical Covariates

`R` modeling functions behave differently for numerical and categorical covariates. 

It is important to always know of what type variables are. Use `str()` on a `data.frame` (or `glimpse()` after loading the `tidyverse`) to obtain information regarding the structure, including variable types: 

```{r}
str(sat.act) ## alternatively tibble::glimpse(sat.act)
```

- Numerical covariates are `int` or `num`.
- Categorical covariates are `Factor` (or `character`).

**Make sure all categorical variables are factors before adding them to a statistical model!**

# Interim Summary

- The `R` `formula` interface allows symbolic specification of statistical models.
  - `+` = main effects
  - `:` = interaction
  - `*` = main effects plus interaction
  - `0+`/`-1` = no intercept


- Categorical variables are transformed into numerical variables using contrast functions (via `model.matrix()`; see Cohen et al., 2002)
  - If models include interactions, orthogonal contrasts (e.g., `contr.sum`) in which the intercept corresponds to the (unweighted) grand mean should be used: `afex::set_sum_contrasts()`
  - Dummy/treatment contrasts (`R` default) lead to simple effects for lower order effects.
  - **Coding only affects interpretation of parameters/tests not overall model fit.**


- For models with solely numerical independent variables, suppressing intercept works as expected.
- For models with categorical independent variables, suppressing intercept or other lower-order effects often leads to very surprising results (and should generally be avoided).

- Type II and III tests equivalent for balanced designs (i.e., equal group sizes) and highest-order effect.
- Type III tests require orthogonal contrasts (e.g.,`contr.sum`); recommended:
  - For experimental designs in which imbalance is completely random and not structural,
  - Complete cross-over interactions (i.e., main effects in presence of interaction) possible.
- Type II are more appropriate if imbalance is structural (i.e., observational data; maybe here).

# Beyond Linear Models with Normal Residual Distribution

Statistical models defined by relationship of covariates and assumption of residual probability distribution. `formula` defines the relationship of covariates, `function` defines distributional assumption.


- (1) Most models assume independent data points (i.e., no replicates or repeated measures):  
- `lm()` linear model (normal distribution of residuals, includes multivariate IVs)
- `glm()` generalized linear model (other residual distribution, e.g., binomial, Poisson)
- `MASS::rlm()` robust linear model
- `MASS::polr()` ordered logistic or probit regression
- `MASS::loglm()` log-linear model (for contingency tables)
- `nnet::multinom()` models for multinomial data
- `ordinal::clm()` cumulative link models for ordinal data


- (2) Models support repeated-measures usually via random-effects parameters:
- `nlme::lme()` linear mixed-effects models (generally superseded by `lme4`)
- `lme4::lmer()` linear mixed-effects models (modern implementation)
- `lme4::glmer()` generalized linear mixed-effects models
- `ordinal::clmm2()` cumulative link mixed models for ordinal data
- `mcmcGLMM` Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects models
- `rstanarm::stan_lmer()`/`stan_glmer()` **Bayesian (generalized) linear mixed-effects models**
- `brms::brm()` **general framework for formula-based Bayesian models; extremely flexible**

# Summary: Analysis with Statistical Models in R

1. Identify probability distribution of data (more correct: of residuals/conditional distribution)
2. Make sure variables are of correct type via `str()`
3. Set appropriate contrasts (orthogonal contrasts if model includes interaction): `afex::set_sum_contrasts()`
4. Describe statistical model using `formula`
4. Fit model: pass `formula` and `data.frame` to corresponding modeling function (e.g., `lm()`, `glm()`)
4. Check model fit (e.g., inspect residuals)
5. Test terms (i.e., main effects and interactions): Pass fitted model to `car::Anova()`  
    Note: parameter estimates (e.g., `coef` or `summary`) are often not informative for models involving categorical variables, especially if the variables have more than three levels.
7. Follow-up tests: 
   - Estimated marginal means: Pass fitted model to `emmeans::emmeans()` (formerly `lsmeans`)
   - Specify specific contrasts on estimated marginal means (e.g., `contrast()`, `pairs()`)

`afex` combines correct coding (3.), fitting (5.) and testing (7.):
- ANOVAs: `afex::aov_car()`, `afex::aov_ez()`, or `afex::aov_4()`
- (Generalized) linear mixed-effects models: `afex::mixed()`

# Repeated-Measures

class: inline-grey
# IID Assumption

- Ordinary linear regression, between-subjects ANOVA, and basically all standard statistical models share one assumption: Data points are *independent and identically distributed* (*iid*).
  - Independence assumption refers to residuals: After taking structure of model (i.e., parameters) into account, probability of a data point having a specific value is independent of all other data points.
  - Identical distribution: All observations sampled from same distribution.


- For repeated-measures independence assumption often violated (e.g., data points from one participant more likely to be similar to each other).
- Violation of independence assumption can have dramatic consequences on statistical inferences from a model (e.g., increased or decreased Type I errors).


- Three approaches for dealing with repeated-measures (e.g., Gelman & Hill, 2007):
  1. *Complete pooling*: Ignore dependency in data (often not appropriate, results likely biased, not trustworthy)
  2. *No pooling*: Separate data based on factor producing dependency and calculate separate statistical model for each subset (individual-level parameters prone to overfitting, combining results can be non-trivial)
  3. *Partial pooling*: Analyse data jointly while taking dependency into account (gold standard, e.g., mixed models, hierarchical models)

---
class: small

### Complete Pooling
- 1 set of parameters $\Theta$ for data *n*, usually aggregated across participants
- Likelihood: $ln(L({\bf n} \mid \Theta))$
- Easy to implement
- Ignores individual variability

--

### No Pooling
- 1 set of parameters $\Theta_i$ for each individual data set ${\bf n_i}$
- Likelihood: $\sum_{i = 1}^N ln(L({\bf n_i} \mid \Theta_i))$
- Requires considerable data on the individual level, otherwise parameter prone to overfitting
- Results sometimes not easy to combine

--

### Partial Pooling
- 1 set of group-level parameters ${\hat \Theta}$ and 1 set of parameters $\Theta_i$ for each individual data set ${\bf n_i}$
- Likelihood: $\sum_{i = 1}^N ln(L({\bf n_i} \mid \Theta_i, {\hat \Theta})) + ln(L(\Theta_i \mid {\hat \Theta}))$
- Requires distributional assumption for group-level parameters (e.g., individual-level data normally distributed around group-level parameters)
- Provides on average better estimates for both individual-level and group-level parameters (e.g., [Stein's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein%27s_example))
- Estimation can be difficult in a frequentist setting (alternatives: penalized or restricted maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation)

- Conditional = *if-then* statement; e.g., If global warning continues, London will be flooded.
- Bayesian reasoning often assumes 'the Equation': *P*(if *A* then *B*) = *P*(*B*|*A*)
- Our question: Does 'the Equation' hold? 
- Participants provide idiosyncratic estimates of both *P*(if *A* then *B*) and *P*(*B*|*A*).

- ~100 participants recruited via `crowdflower.com` worked on 12 items:

> Sophia's scenario: Sophia wishes to find a nice present for her 13-year-old son, Tim, for Christmas. She is running on a tight budget, but she knows that Tim loves participating in live role-playing in the forest and she is really skilled at sewing the orc costumes he needs. Unfortunately, she will not be able to afford the leather parts that such costumes usually have, but she will still be able to make them look nice.

--

(1) *P*(*B*|*A*) (`B_given_A`):
  > Suppose Sophia makes Tim an orc costume.
  > Under this assumption, how probable is it that the following sentence is true:   
  > Tim will be excited about his present.

--

(2) *P*(if *A* then *B*) (`if_A_then_B`):
  > Could you please rate the probability that the following sentence is true:   
  > IF Sophia makes Tim an orc costume, THEN he will be excited about his present.
