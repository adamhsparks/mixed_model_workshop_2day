Dear all,

Our workshop on mixed models will take place on ... from ...

Please bring your laptop and prepare it beforehand. The preparation includes (details below):
- Updating both R and RStudio, 
- installing a few R packages, 
- and making sure that xaringan presentations can be produced. 

If you want to have a more theoretical introduction, you might want to read my chapter on mixed models:
http://singmann.org/download/publications/singmann_kellen-introduction-mixed-models.pdf
We will discuss most of its content during the workshop.

In the interest of spending the time of the workshop on its content, it is important that you perform the above mentioned steps one or two days before the workshop. We are a relatively large group so we will not have the time to solve all installation problems at the day of the workshop. So please make sure you do this beforehand!

The latest version of R is 3.6.1 and can be downloaded from: https://cloud.r-project.org/
The latest version of RStudio is 1.2.1335 and can be downloaded from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
On Windows, I had some problems with the latest RStudio version when compiling RMarkdown documents. To solve those, I have installed the latest preview version, 1.2.1555, which you can get from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

Please note that both R and RStudio need to be updated independently. Also note that older versions of R/RStudio are potentially not working properly.

After updating both R and RStudio, please install the following R packages [e.g., via install.packages("package")]:
afex
emmeans
MEMSS
psych
tidyverse
broom
xaringan
sjPlot
GGally
ggbeeswarm
ggpol

If you already had the latest version of R installed or could not install the latest version, at least make sure your packages are up to date by running the following command (it makes some sense to run this every month or so):
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

After installation of these packages, please ensure that you can produce ("knit") xaringan presentations. For this, start RStudio and create a new example presentation:
- In RStudio select from the menu File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation 
- Save the newly created RMarkdown document somewhere (e.g., as "test.Rmd" on your Desktop)
- Click on "Knit" (above the code, below the menu). Note that clicking "Knit" for the first time might prompt the installation of additional packages. 

If successful, clicking "Knit" should create and open the example presentation ("Presentation Ninja - with xaringan ...") as an html file (e.g., "test.html"). The file will likely be opened in an RStudio internal html viewer. Clicking "Open in Browser" will open the file in a browser.

All workshop materials will be made available on the evening before the workshop at: https://github.com/singmann/mixed_model_workshop_2day/releases
Download the corresponding zip or tar.gz archive ("Source code"). This archive contains all slides and code used at the workshop. 

Until then, you can look at the workshop materials at: https://github.com/singmann/mixed_model_workshop_2day

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop,
Henrik
