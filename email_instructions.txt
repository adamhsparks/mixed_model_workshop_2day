Please bring your laptop and prepare it beforehand. This includes:
- Updating both R and RStudio, 
- installing a few R packages, 
- and making sure that xaringan presentations can be produced. 

In the interest of spending the time of the tutorial on its content, it is important that you do this at least one or two days before the tutorial. I will not have the time to solve installation problems at the day of the tutorial. So please make sure you do this beforehand!

The latest version of R is 3.6.0 and can be downloaded from: https://cloud.r-project.org/
The latest version of RStudio is 1.1.463 and can be downloaded from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

Please note that both R and RStudio need to be updated independently and older versions of R/RStudio are likely to not work properly.

After updating both R and RStudio, please install the following R packages [e.g., via install.packages("package")]:
afex
MEMSS
psych
tidyverse
broom
xaringan
sjPlot
GGally
ggbeeswarm
ggpol


After installation of these packages, please ensure that you can produce ("knit") xaringan presentations. For this, start RStudio and create a new example presentation:
- In RStudio select from the menu File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation 
- Save the newly created RMarkdown document somewhere (e.g., as "test.Rmd" on your Desktop)
- Click on "Knit" (above the code, below the menu). Note that clicking "Knit" for the first time might prompt the installation of additional packages. 

If successful, clicking "Knit" should create and open the example presentation ("Presentation Ninja - with xaringan ...") as an html file (e.g., "test.html"). The file will likely be opened in an RStudio internal html viewer. Clicking "Open in Browser" will open the file in a browser.

All workshop materials will be made available from tomorrow evening: https://github.com/singmann/mixed_model_workshop_2day/releases
Download the corresponding zip or tar.gz archive ("Source code"). This archive contains all slides and code used at the workshop. 
Please note that it is possible that I will update the materials until the workshop.
